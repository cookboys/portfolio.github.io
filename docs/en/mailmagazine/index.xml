      <description>Coincheck Normal Mailmagazine Design    CONCEPT I was in charge of design and coding of the mail magazine distributed by Coincheck.

      <description>Coincheck Food Mailmagazine Design    CONCEPT I was in charge of design and coding of the mail magazine distributed by Coincheck.
This was an e-mail magazine mainly for cultivating restaurants, so I used images that illustrate eating and drinking in illustrations.
I also instructed Illustrator of outsourcing by myself.

      <description>Coincheck Payment Mailmagazine Design    CONCEPT I was in charge of design and coding of the mail magazine distributed by Coincheck.
This was mainly a banner to promote multi-store settlement of bit coins (shopping, electric payment, other life infrastructure), so I assumed an image that is doing shopping happily with bit coin.
I also instructed the illustrator of outsourcing by myself.
