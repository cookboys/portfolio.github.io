      <description>Coincheck Blog Design / WordPress,Scss    CONCEPT Coincheck&#39;s blog was redesigned.
As a basic principle, I was conscious of the establishment of corporate color.
Also, since financial instruments are not real, we designed with paying attention to showing images that are points of contact with users.
Overall, we designed to aim a little pop atmosphere.

      <description>Portfolio Site Design / Hugo,PostCSS / Multilingual    CONCEPT It will be a portfolio site made with HUGO.
Although I operated Jekyll in business, I have problems such as &#34;Can not search for tags and categories&#34;, &#34;I can not set permalink&#34;, etc. I tried to make it into Hugo.
The static site generator is useful, but because Jekyll did not have advanced features associated with the DB, we could use it without tying it with the DB and chose more versatile Hugo.</description>
