    <h2 class="post__text--title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>It becomes a banner posted on Facebook.</p>
    <p>Because the banner of the illustration I created last time was popular, I asked the illustrator who made the illustration, I made an original illustration and created a banner.</p>
    <p>I created instructions for illustrator as well.</p>
