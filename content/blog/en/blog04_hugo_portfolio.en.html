    <p>It will be a portfolio site made with HUGO.</p>
    <p>Although I operated Jekyll in business, I have problems such as "Can not search for tags and categories", "I can not set permalink", etc. I tried to make it into Hugo.</p>
    <p>The static site generator is useful, but because Jekyll did not have advanced features associated with the DB, we could use it without tying it with the DB and chose more versatile Hugo.</p>
    <p>Also, because it is made by Golang, we have adopted the merit that Build is early.</p>
    <p>CSS tried using popular PostCSS now.</p>
