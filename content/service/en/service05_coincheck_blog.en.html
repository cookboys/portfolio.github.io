    <p>Coincheck's blog was redesigned.</p>
    <p>As a basic principle, I was conscious of the establishment of corporate color.</p>
    <p>Also, since financial instruments are not real, we designed with paying attention to showing images that are points of contact with users.</p>
    <p>Overall, we designed to aim a little pop atmosphere.</p>
