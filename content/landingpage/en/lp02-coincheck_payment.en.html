    <h2 class="text__wrapper__title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I redesigned the top page of Coincheck Payment.</p>
    <p>The concept was created by imagining "spread of bit coin settlement".</p>
    <p>In the background circle and line, in the future bit-coin settlement spread all over the world, designing with the thought / wish that one of the world's basic currencies is a bit coin.</p>
    <p>In addition, by expressing the merit of bit coin settlement with icon + character, we emphasized visually easy-to-understand and designed to eliminate further suspiciousness.</p>
