    <h2 class="post__text--title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I designed the top page of Coincheck Lending (Rental virtual currency).</p>
    <p>The concept is "the concept of a new virtual currency".</p>
    <p>In the first view, I tried to place new images reminiscent of the feeling of the near future and remind me of new services different from other companies.</p>
    <p>In addition, I put a bit of "pop" images, icons on the whole, I tried to design such that "bitterness" possessed by bit coins was dispelled.</p>
