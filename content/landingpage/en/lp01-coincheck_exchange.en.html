    <h2 class="text__wrapper__title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I redesigned the top page of Coincheck.</p>
    <p>The concept was "establishment of corporate color", "simple but easy to use, user friendly design" I tried.</p>
    <p>Also, as Coincheck was also a big point in the number of currencies, I also pay attention to appealing the number of currencies as an appeal axis.</p>
