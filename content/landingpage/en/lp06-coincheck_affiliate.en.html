    <h2 class="post__text--title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I designed the landing page of the linked banner affixed by Coincheck's affiliate.</p>
    <p>Illustration of First View included an image that "Affiliators introduce and Coincheck will spread all over the world".</p>
    <p>Because there were many voices that discontinued animation was not sure how to receive reward of affiliate program, we made animation and made it easy to understand visually. In addition, this animation will be played even in smartphone.</p>
