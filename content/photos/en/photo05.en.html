    <p>Prepare an image of a woman holding a smartphone.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Crop the image</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo05_02.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Using the "Pen tool" of Photoshop, we will trace around the image with a path.</p>
    <p>Based on the path, create a selection and mask it.</p>
    <p>Using the "borderline adjustment brush tool", the hair is masked so as not to feel uncomfortable with a good feeling.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Combine texture</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo05_03.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Prepare a texture image and combine it into a photo.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Blur the texture tip</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo05_04.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Use the selection area and mask to slightly blur the edges of the texture.</p>
    <p>Select a texture in the round selection area and use Blur Border to blur the selection boundary.</p>
    <p>Then apply a mask.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Composite</h2>

      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo05_05.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Because it was able to clip and synthesize, I will synthesize it with a good feeling! (Actually adjusts tone curve, color balance, etc.)</p>
