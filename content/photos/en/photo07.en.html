    <h3>Crop a person from a complex photograph</h3>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Prepare a cropped image</h2>
    <figure>

    <p>I will prepare a picture of the woman whose ocean is reflected in the background.</p>
    <p>Complex ocean background with hair dancing in the wind and rippling background.</p>
    <p>It is difficult to cut out, but cut out only the person of this material.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Crop the image</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo07_02.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Using "Quick Selection Tool", create selection area roughly along the person.</p>
    <p>I use masks of "selection and mask" to mask the image roughly.</p>
    <p>"Edge detection: 250 px" "Smart radius = put a check"</p>
    <p>"Global adjustment" is fixed as follows. "Edge shift: 70%" "Output setting: Extract unnecessary color: Application degree 70%"</p>
    <p>I use the "boundary line adjustment brush tool" to fill the hair and paint it in.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Correct the mask</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo07_03.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Right-click on the layer panel → select "apply layer mask". Only image layers.</p>
    <p>command (Win -> Ctrl) - Click to select a layer and create a selection.</p>
    <p>We use "selection and mask" to create the mask again.</p>
    <p>Set "Edge shift: -20%". The value sets the adaptation value by looking at the picture.</p>
    <p>Since part of the body has been displayed, open the "Channel" panel and adjust the mask.</p>
    <p>Using "Pen tool", create a path along the outline of the body. Create a selection by "Create selection".</p>
    <p>Fill the body with white, paint around the body with black, and adjust the mask around the body.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Adjust the edge</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo07_04.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Since "shift edge" is still weak, adjust the mask again by applying the edge.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Finally adjust finely</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo07_05.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>We will carefully remove garbage around the hair that is still left, using the "selection and mask" "brush tool".</p>
    <p>Finally, "Create a new layer" → "Create a clipping mask". Change the drawing mode of the layer to "hue".</p>
    <p>The color of hair is extracted with "eyedropper tool". Along the hair, paint the color with the brush tool and make the color of the hair more natural.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Composite</h2>
