    <p>Prepare an image of a woman using a personal computer.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Crop the image</h2>
    {{< figure  src="/images/photos/photo03_02.png" alt="">}}
    <p>Using the "Pen tool" of Photoshop, we will trace around the image with a path.</p>
    <p>Based on the path, create a selection and mask it.</p>
    <p>Using the "borderline adjustment brush tool", the hair is masked so as not to feel uncomfortable with a good feeling.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Fit the screen of the personal computer</h2>
    {{< figure  src="/images/photos/photo03_03.png" alt="">}}
    <p>Fit the image you want to fit on the screen of the computer.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Adjust the reflection of the screen</h2>
    {{< figure  src="/images/photos/photo03_04.png" alt="">}}
    <p>Because it is still uncomfortable with this, I will reflect off the screen of the personal computer.</p>
    <p>Along the screen of the computer, create a gradation of white to black.</p>
    <p>Use the "blurring tool" to blur the edge of the right side.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Adjust reflection</h2>
    {{< figure  src="/images/photos/photo03_05.png" alt="">}}
    <p>After creating the gradation, change the layer to "Screen".</p>
    <p>Then fine-tune the opacity of the layer.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Add a drop shadow</h2>
    {{< figure  src="/images/photos/photo03_06.png" alt="">}}
    <p>Add "Layer Effect" â†’ "Drop Shadow" to the clipped image.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Composite</h2>
    {{< figure src="/images/photos/photo03_07.png" alt="">}}
    <p>Because it was able to clip and synthesize, I will synthesize it with a good feeling! (Actually adjusts tone curve, color balance, etc.)</p>
