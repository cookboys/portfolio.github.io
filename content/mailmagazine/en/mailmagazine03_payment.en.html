    <h2 class="post__text--title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I was in charge of design and coding of the mail magazine distributed by Coincheck.</p>
    <p>This was mainly a banner to promote multi-store settlement of bit coins (shopping, electric payment, other life infrastructure), so I assumed an image that is doing shopping happily with bit coin.</p>
    <p>I also instructed the illustrator of outsourcing by myself.</p>
