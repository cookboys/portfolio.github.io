    <h2 class="post__text--title">CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>I was in charge of design and coding of the mail magazine distributed by Coincheck.</p>
    <p>This was an e-mail magazine mainly for cultivating restaurants, so I used images that illustrate eating and drinking in illustrations.</p>
    <p>I also instructed Illustrator of outsourcing by myself.</p>
